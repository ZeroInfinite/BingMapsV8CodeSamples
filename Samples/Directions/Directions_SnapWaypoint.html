        <legend>Snap Directions Waypoint to Pushpin Sample</legend>
        This sample shows how to snap a directions route to pushpins on the map. 
        The usefulness of this sample is that normally dragging the route on the map will snap to where ever you stopped draggin the route, 
        but if you are zoomed out and have pushpins displayed on the map, dragging the route to a pushpin normally might actually snap to a 
        point that is several blocks away from the pushpin. 
        This sample detects when a route has been dragged to a pushpin and snaps its waypoint to the locaiton of that pushpin.
